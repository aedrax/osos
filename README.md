# OpenSooose

The end goal is to develop a fully-functional x86 operating system.
For now, this file will be used by the developers to communicate their
progress.

You are welcome to contribute, assuming you:

1. Begin where we left off.
2. Clearly document the progress you make.
3. Do not stray from LittleOSBook in any way.
4. Document any errors you receive.

That said, let's make something cool. You can find the textbook,
Little OS Book, here: http://littleosbook.github.io/. Try to complete
sections in their entirety, so we don't get confused about where we left off.
